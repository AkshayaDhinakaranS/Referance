              Some job candidates have reported receiving fraudulent offers
              after posting their resumes on certain websites and portals from
              people posing as Cognizant employees. These notifications may
              involve promises regarding the selection process. In some cases,
              prospective candidates are asked for payment as a condition for
              consideration. The documents may appear legitimate, with our
              company logo or personal details taken from social networking
              pages. They may include a job description and salary details.
              Cognizant does not charge a fee at any stage of the recruitment
              process and has not authorized any agencies or partners to collect
              any fee for recruitment. Our core values include integrity and
              transparency. We are committed to an open hiring process, and we
              are not connected with these types of services or individuals. We
              are not liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result of
              dealing with such entities. If you receive any Campus/Fresher
              specific offers you suspect are fraudulent, please email us. If
              you receive any offers you suspect are fraudulent, please email
              us.
